ggm_combine: written by Jeremy Sanders, released under the GPLv2+

ggm_combine is a GUI tool for combining together GGM-filtered images
with different scales. It presents a control for varying the scaling
with radius for each input image. A checkbox for each image also
allows scales to be switched on and off.

Requirements: Python 2.7, PyQt4, numpy, pyfits, PyYaml, ds9

The current implementation is VERY BASIC and USER-UNFRIENDLY, so
please feel free to send improvements to the code.

The user has to create a series of fits files with the GGM-filtered
images which should be combined (e.g. using scales of
sigma=1,2,4,8,16...)

The user should then copy the template ggm_combine.yml. The file
should be edited to set:

 - The central pixel (to measure radii from), based from 0
 - An optional chop range to speed up the interactive modification
   (note this can be enabled/disabled as necessary)
 - Output filename, written to while the program is used
 - List of input filenames, and scaling values

To use the program

# start an instance of ds9
ds9 &

# run the interactive GUI
./interactive.py input.yml &

As the scaling radii and scales are modified, the output values are
written to out-pars.yml. Rename this to something safe (and the output
fits file) if you want to keep a particular set of parameters.

To modify the number of radial points, the yml file has to be edited.

Note that WCS is lost in the output file!
